# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Import the sys module.
### Step 2: 
 Pass the filename as the first argument after the name of script. Open the file as sys.argv[1]
### Step 3: 
Read the file using read() method.
### Step 4:  
Use split() method to split the file content into words.
### Step 5: 
Use len() to find the total words.
### Step 6: 
Use len() to find the total words.
## PROGRAM:
```python
#Program for getting word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.

import sys

with open(sys.argv[1],'r') as f:
    num_of_words =0
    for i in f:
        word =i.split()
        num_of_words += len(word)
print("Number of words={}".format(num_of_words))
```
